# phone-call-web-clone

This a react proect of recreating my phone call app. The code is written in all react, no extra-ordinary extentions added.
I learnt more of react component management with react. I also learnt error handling and useEffect hook. I did not have a backend setup for the project as I am focus on Frontend development.
React has proven to be a very good technology for fast web app building. 

Hopeing to learn more.
